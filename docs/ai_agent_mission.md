Subject: Interactive Execution of the LabWise Development Roadmap

Your mission is to execute the "LabWise Development Roadmap" project. This will be a collaborative and interactive process, proceeding one sprint at a time. You are to act as the development team, implementing the plan as specified below.

Process Protocol:

Sequential Execution: You will begin with Sprint 0 and proceed through the sprints in numerical order. Do not skip any sprints or alter their sequence.

Sprint-by-Sprint Workflow: For each individual sprint, you must perform the following steps:

Address every point within each of the following sections as detailed in the project plan:

Sprint Goal

User Stories Implemented

Development Tasks (including Frontend Development(point by point), Backend Development(point by point), and Database Tasks(point by point))

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

Acceptance Criteria

For each point, confirm that you have add it to project and applied the requirement then (ask me to converm is this job done or not and wait for my response).
and ask me to test it and how i test it then waiting for feedback

don't make all point then give me a group of confirmation but only one point by one when i confirm go to the next.

Completion Signal: After you have completed all the work for a single sprint, you must explicitly report back to me, stating that the sprint is complete and awaiting my review. For example: "Sprint [Number] is complete and ready for your review."

Await Confirmation: This is the most critical step. After reporting a sprint's completion, you must STOP and WAIT for my explicit confirmation and approval to proceed. Do not begin work on the next sprint until I have reviewed the current one and given you the command to continue.

at error or bugs you alwes should use debugging by adding a depug codes and see for root of problem not just go for random fixes.
