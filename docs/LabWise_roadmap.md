Sprint 0: Project Foundation & Core Security


Sprint Goal

The primary objective of Sprint 0 is to establish the foundational infrastructure and implement the critical, system-wide security framework before any feature development begins. This sprint is dedicated to building the bedrock upon which the entire application will rest, ensuring that security and compliance are integral components from the very first line of code.

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Initialize the frontend application framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
●	Implement the core application layout shell, including placeholders for the Global Header and the role-based Navigation Sidebar as defined in the UI/UX Design Blueprint.1
●	Build the Login page UI, utilizing the components, color tokens, and typography specified in the LabWise Design System.1
●	Implement client-side authentication logic, including secure storage and handling of JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
●	Create a protected routing system that programmatically redirects unauthenticated users to the login page, preventing unauthorized access to application views.

Backend Development

●	Initialize the backend application framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django).
●	Establish and configure the database connection to the MongoDB instance.
●	Implement the users collection schema in the application's data models, as defined in the Backend Technical Specification.2
●	Create the public POST /api/v1/auth/login endpoint to handle user authentication against the users collection.2
●	Create the protected GET /api/v1/auth/me endpoint to allow authenticated clients to retrieve their own user profile.2
●	Implement the core JWT generation and validation service, which will be used to issue and verify access tokens.
●	Implement the core Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Enforcement Middleware. This middleware is a critical component that will intercept every incoming API request, validate the user's JWT, and check their role against a predefined access control list before allowing the request to proceed to the business logic layer.2

Database Tasks

●	Deploy and configure the production MongoDB instance.
●	Create the users collection and apply the necessary indexes on the email field to ensure high-performance lookups during login operations.2

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

The most significant risk in any application handling Protected Health Information (PHI) is a security or compliance failure.3 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates stringent controls over data access, making security a non-negotiable prerequisite.3 By dedicating an entire initial sprint to authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), the project front-loads the mitigation of this critical risk.
The RBAC matrix, detailed in the Backend Specification, is not merely a feature list; it is the architectural constitution of the application's security, enforcing the "minimum necessary" principle at the API level.2 The decision to implement the RBAC middleware
before any feature-specific endpoints exist is a deliberate strategic choice. It ensures that security is a foundational, unavoidable layer of the architecture. This creates a "secure by default" development environment where any new endpoint added in subsequent sprints will automatically pass through this security checkpoint, dramatically reducing the possibility of an accidental security vulnerability or compliance breach. This approach is analogous to building a secure scaffolding and foundation before constructing the building itself, ensuring structural integrity from the ground up.

Key Table: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Matrix

The following table, sourced directly from the Backend Specification, serves as the definitive contract for the RBAC middleware implementation. It is the single source of truth for all permissions in the system.2
Endpoint	Method	Receptionist	Technician	Manager	Physician	Patient
/auth/login	POST	C	C	C	C	C
/auth/me	GET	R	R	R	R	R
/users	POST			C		
/patients	POST	C		C		
/orders	POST	C		C	C	
/orders	GET	R	R (Worklist)	R	R (Own)	R (Own)
/samples/accession	POST		C	C		
/results/verify	POST		C	C		
/inventory	GET		R (Read-only)	R		
/audit-logs	GET			R		
C=Create, R=Read, U=Update, D=Delete

Acceptance Criteria

●	A developer can successfully log in via the UI with valid credentials and receive a JWT.
●	An attempt to log in with invalid credentials fails with a 401 Unauthorized error response and a user-friendly message on the UI.
●	An authenticated user's browser securely stores the JWT and includes it in the header of subsequent API requests.
●	An unauthenticated user attempting to access a protected application route is automatically redirected to the login page.
●	A logged-in user with the 'Receptionist' role who attempts to make an API call to a manager-only endpoint (e.g., GET /api/v1/audit-logs) receives a 403 Forbidden error from the backend middleware.
________________________________________
Sprint 1: System Configuration (Manager MVP)


Sprint Goal

The objective of this sprint is to deliver the minimum viable product (MVP) for the Lab Manager persona, empowering them to perform the initial system setup. This includes managing user accounts and defining the laboratory's complete test catalog. These functions are a fundamental prerequisite for any other workflow in the system, as no orders can be placed or users can log in until the system is properly configured.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-MGR-04: As a Lab Manager, I need a centralized administrative module to manage user accounts and define role-based permissions, so that I can ensure that receptionists cannot verify lab results and technicians cannot modify billing information, thereby enforcing the principle of least privilege.3 (This sprint focuses on the user creation/management aspect of this story).

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the "User Management" page, ensuring it is only accessible to users with the 'Manager' role via the protected routing system. The page will feature a Data Table component to list all system users, adhering to the visual specifications for tables in the UI/UX Blueprint.1
●	Implement "Add User" and "Edit User" forms within Modal Window components. These forms will include fields for first name, last name, email, and a dropdown for role selection, using the specified Text Input Field and button components.1
●	Build the "Test Catalog Management" page, also restricted to the 'Manager' role. This page will use a Data Table to list all available tests and panels.
●	Implement "Add Test" and "Edit Test" modal forms. These will be complex forms that capture all fields from the testCatalog schema, including nested objects for defining demographic-specific reference ranges and machine-readable rules for automated reflex testing.1

Backend Development

●	Implement the full MongoDB schemas for the testCatalog and patients collections within the backend application's data models.2
●	Create the full suite of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for /api/v1/users, allowing for the management of user accounts.
●	Create the full suite of CRUD API endpoints for /api/v1/testCatalog, allowing for the management of the laboratory's test menu.
●	Ensure every new endpoint created in this sprint is rigorously protected by the RBAC middleware implemented in Sprint 0, verifying that only users with the 'Manager' role can access them.

Database Tasks

●	Create the testCatalog and patients collections in the MongoDB database.
●	Apply the necessary indexes on testCode in the testCatalog collection and mrn in the patients collection to ensure efficient lookups.2

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

The Backend Technical Specification outlines a critical compliance requirement known as "snapshotting".2 This means that when a test order is created, it must create a permanent, immutable copy of the test's details—including its name, methodology, and reference range—as they exist
at that exact moment in time. This is a direct response to CLIA regulations, which mandate that a patient's historical report must always reflect the precise conditions and reference values that were valid on the day of testing.3
This requirement creates a direct and non-negotiable dependency: the testCatalog module must be fully implemented before the order entry module. If order entry were built first, every order created would be technically deficient and non-compliant, lacking the required snapshotted data. This would necessitate a complex and high-risk data migration later in the project to retroactively fix these records. By building the testCatalog management tools first, the plan ensures that Lab Managers can populate the system with accurate, version-controlled test definitions. This data will then be available to be correctly snapshotted when the order entry feature is developed in a subsequent sprint. This sequencing completely de-risks the project's core compliance posture and ensures data integrity from the very first patient order.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A user logged in as a Lab Manager can successfully navigate to and view the User Management and Test Catalog pages from the main navigation sidebar.
●	A Lab Manager can successfully create a new user, view that user in the list, update their role, and deactivate their account.
●	A Lab Manager can successfully create a new test in the catalog, define its specimen requirements, set multiple age- and gender-specific reference ranges, and save it.
●	A user logged in with a 'Technician' or 'Receptionist' role receives a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to access the API endpoints for user or test catalog management, and the corresponding navigation links are not visible in their UI.
________________________________________
Sprint 2: Pre-Analytical - Patient Registration


Sprint Goal

The goal of this sprint is to deliver the first critical step of the core sample lifecycle: enabling a Receptionist to accurately and efficiently register a new patient or find an existing one. This workflow is the entry point for all pre-analytical data and is a primary source of errors in traditional lab systems.3

User Stories Implemented

●	US-REC-01: As a Receptionist, I need to scan a patient's driver's license and insurance card using a simple 2D barcode scanner, so that the system automatically populates the patient's name, address, DOB, and insurance policy information into the registration fields, thereby minimizing typographical errors and reducing patient check-in time.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the "Patient Registration" page, which will serve as a primary workspace for the Receptionist persona.1
●	The page design will lead with a prominent search bar to encourage finding existing patients by Name, MRN, or Date of Birth. Search results will be displayed in a Data Table component, allowing for quick selection.1
●	Implement the "Create New Patient" workflow. This action, secondary to the search, will open a clean, well-structured registration form.
●	The registration form will include all necessary fields as defined in the patients collection schema, such as demographics and insurance information, using the standard Text Input Field components.1
●	Implement the "Scan ID / Insurance Card" feature as a Primary Button on the form.1 For this sprint, this will be a simulated action. Clicking the button will trigger a function that auto-populates the form fields with mock data, demonstrating the end-to-end workflow specified in US-REC-01 and the UI/UX Blueprint without requiring physical hardware integration at this stage.1

Backend Development

●	Implement the POST /api/v1/patients endpoint, which will handle the creation of new patient records based on the data submitted from the registration form.2
●	Implement a robust GET /api/v1/patients endpoint. This endpoint must support query parameters to enable searching by mrn, lastName, and other key identifiers to power the "search-first" workflow.2
●	The business logic for the POST /patients endpoint must include a crucial validation step to check for the existence of the submitted MRN. If a patient with the given MRN already exists, the API must return a 409 Conflict status code to prevent the creation of duplicate records.2

Database Tasks

●	This sprint will involve heavy interaction with the patients collection. The development team must verify that the indexes on the primary search fields (mrn, lastName) are effective and provide the required performance for a fast, responsive user experience.

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

The Business Requirements Document explicitly identifies the prevention of duplicate patient records as a mission-critical objective to avert potentially catastrophic clinical errors.3 A single patient having multiple records can lead to a fragmented medical history, resulting in misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment. The UI/UX Design Blueprint directly addresses this risk by architecting a "search-first" workflow.1 On the patient registration screen, the most prominent, visually emphasized action is to search for an existing patient. The "Create New Patient" button is presented as a secondary, alternative path.
This design choice creates what is known as a "pit of success" for the user. The path of least resistance—the most obvious and easiest workflow—is the correct one: to search before creating. Creating a new patient requires a more deliberate, conscious action from the user, reducing the likelihood of accidental duplicates. The backend architecture fully supports this preventative strategy by providing a powerful search API (GET /patients) and, as a final failsafe, enforcing absolute uniqueness on the mrn at the database level via the POST /patients endpoint logic.2 By building this complete vertical slice, the team is not merely delivering a feature; it is implementing a comprehensive, end-to-end error prevention strategy for the single most critical data entity in the entire LabWise system.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A Receptionist can search for a patient by their MRN and Last Name, and the results are displayed clearly in the data table.
●	If a patient is not found through search, the Receptionist can successfully open the new patient registration form.
●	Clicking the simulated "Scan ID" button correctly populates the name, address, DOB, and insurance fields on the form.
●	Submitting a valid registration form successfully creates a new patient record in the database, and the system provides clear confirmation.
●	Attempting to create a new patient with an MRN that already exists in the system is blocked by the backend, and a user-friendly error message is displayed on the UI, prompting the user to search for the existing patient instead.
________________________________________
Sprint 3: Pre-Analytical - Test Order Entry


Sprint Goal

To deliver the core order entry workflow, enabling a Receptionist to create a new, billable test order and link it to a patient record. This sprint builds directly upon the patient and test catalog foundations from Sprints 1 and 2.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-REC-04: As a Receptionist, when entering a test order, I need the system to present a smart search field that suggests tests as I type, and which requires a corresponding ICD-10 diagnosis code from a searchable list, so that I can ensure a complete and billable order is created.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the "Order Entry" page, accessible from the Receptionist's navigation.1
●	Implement a smart search field for the test catalog. As the user types, the component will query the backend and display a list of matching tests and panels.1
●	When a test is selected, add it to an "order summary" view on the page.
●	Implement a searchable ICD-10 diagnosis code selector, which is a required field for completing the order.1
●	Upon submission, the UI will send the complete order payload, including the patient ID, selected test codes, and diagnosis code, to the backend API.

Backend Development

●	Implement the POST /api/v1/orders endpoint.2
●	The endpoint's business logic must perform several critical functions:
○	Validate the existence of the provided patientId and physicianId.2
○	For each testCode in the request, retrieve the full test definition from the testCatalog collection.2
○	Perform the "snapshotting" process: embed a copy of the test's name, units, and current reference range directly into the new order document.2
○	Generate a unique, human-readable orderId.2
○	Save the complete order document to the orders collection.2

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint delivers the final and most crucial piece of the pre-analytical data capture process. The strategic core of this sprint is the backend implementation of "snapshotting" as mandated by the Backend Technical Specification.2 By embedding a permanent copy of the test's critical details into the order at the moment of creation, the system ensures 100% compliance with CLIA regulations regarding historical report accuracy.3 This sequencing is non-negotiable; building order entry without the snapshotting logic would create non-compliant records from day one. This sprint ensures that every order is a self-contained, auditable artifact, de-risking a core compliance requirement for the entire project.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A Receptionist can search for a patient and initiate a new order for them.
●	The UI's smart search successfully finds tests from the catalog as the Receptionist types.
●	The system requires the selection of an ICD-10 code before the order can be submitted.
●	A successfully submitted order is created in the database with a Pending status.
●	Inspecting the created order document in the database confirms that test details like name and referenceRange have been snapshotted and are embedded within the document.2
________________________________________
Sprint 4: Pre-Analytical - Scheduling & Financials


Sprint Goal

To complete the Receptionist's toolkit by implementing the appointment scheduling calendar and the asynchronous insurance eligibility verification workflow.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-REC-02: As a Receptionist, I need the system to perform a real-time insurance eligibility and benefits check... so that I can immediately inform the patient of their estimated co-payment.3
●	US-REC-03: As a Receptionist, I need to access a clear, color-coded calendar view of available phlebotomy appointments, so that I can efficiently schedule new patients.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the "Scheduling" page, featuring a full-screen calendar component as the central element.1
●	The calendar will display appointments from the appointments collection, color-coded by status (Scheduled, Arrived, Completed, No-show).1
●	Implement drag-and-drop functionality to reschedule appointments.1
●	On the Patient Registration/Order Entry form, implement a "Verify Eligibility" button.1
●	Clicking this button will call the backend API and display a loading state. The UI will then update with the eligibility status (e.g., "Active Coverage") and co-payment details returned by the asynchronous process.1

Backend Development

●	Implement the full CRUD API endpoints for the /api/v1/appointments resource, allowing for creation, viewing, and updating of schedule slots.2
●	Implement the initial endpoint for the insurance check (e.g., POST /api/v1/patients/{id}/verify-eligibility). This endpoint will not perform the check directly. Instead, it will publish a job to a message queue and immediately return a 202 Accepted response.2
●	Develop a separate "worker" service that listens to the message queue. This service will be responsible for making the (simulated) API call to the external insurance provider and updating the patient's record with the results.2

Database Tasks

●	Create the appointments collection in MongoDB.2
●	Add an index to the scheduledTime field in the appointments collection for efficient calendar queries.2

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint introduces a key architectural pattern: asynchronous processing for long-running or external-dependent tasks.2 The insurance eligibility check is a perfect use case. A synchronous API call to an external provider could be slow, creating a poor user experience and making the LabWise system vulnerable to the provider's downtime. By decoupling this process using a message queue, the UI remains fast and responsive for the Receptionist, and the system becomes more resilient.2 This architectural decision, implemented early for a non-critical feature, establishes a robust pattern that can be reused for other intensive tasks later in the project, such as large report generation or sending batch notifications.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A Receptionist can view the daily appointment schedule on the calendar.
●	A Receptionist can create a new appointment for a patient in an open time slot.
●	A Receptionist can drag an existing appointment to a new time slot, and the change is saved.
●	Clicking the "Verify Eligibility" button on the UI returns an immediate acknowledgment, and the eligibility status updates shortly after without freezing the page.
●	The backend successfully publishes a message to the queue when the eligibility check is requested.
________________________________________
Sprint 5: Analytical Bridge - Sample Accessioning


Sprint Goal

To build the critical handoff point between the pre-analytical and analytical phases. This sprint delivers the barcode-driven workflow for a Lab Technician to formally receive a sample into the laboratory, creating an unbroken digital chain of custody.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-TEC-01: As a Lab Technician, I need to be able to scan a sample's barcode at any workstation, so that the system immediately displays the patient's identity, the tests ordered for that specific sample, and any special handling notes.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the "Accessioning" page, accessible from the Technician's navigation.1
●	The primary UI element will be a simple text input field, optimized for receiving input from a barcode scanner.
●	Upon a successful scan (or manual entry) of an order ID, the UI will display the patient's key identifiers and a list of all samples associated with that order.1
●	The Technician will then be able to perform the "receive" action for each sample, which calls the accessioning API endpoint.

Backend Development

●	Implement the POST /api/v1/samples/accession endpoint.2
●	The business logic for this endpoint must:
○	Find the corresponding order and sample in the database.2
○	Verify that the sample has not already been accessioned to prevent duplicates.2
○	Generate a new, unique accessionNumber (e.g., ACC-2025-00001).2
○	Update the sample's status from AwaitingCollection to InLab as defined in the system's state machine.2
○	Record the receivedTimestamp.2
○	Create an entry in the auditLogs collection for the "SAMPLE_ACCESSIONED" event.2

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint marks the first development work for the Lab Technician persona and the beginning of the analytical workflow. The entire design is centered on the barcode to enforce positive patient identification and eliminate transcription errors, which are a major source of risk in the lab.3 By creating an immutable audit log entry the moment a sample is scanned, the system establishes a legally defensible chain of custody.3 This feature is the foundation of sample tracking within the lab; without it, no subsequent analytical work can be reliably tracked or audited.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A Technician can scan a requisition barcode and see the correct patient and order details on the screen.
●	Successfully accessioning a sample updates its status to InLab in the database.
●	The sample is assigned a unique, sequential accessionNumber.2
●	Attempting to accession the same sample twice results in a 409 Conflict error.2
●	A detailed audit log entry is created for the accessioning event, linking the sample, the user, and the timestamp.2
________________________________________
Sprint 6: Analytical Engine - The Dynamic Worklist


Sprint Goal

To deliver the Lab Technician's primary command center: a dynamic, real-time worklist that automatically prioritizes all active samples in the lab, guiding the technician's focus to the most urgent tasks.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-TEC-02: As a Lab Technician, I need my home screen to be a dynamic, real-time worklist that automatically prioritizes samples, clearly flagging STAT requests in red, overdue samples in yellow... so that I can effectively manage my workload.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the Technician's "Dashboard (Worklist)" page, which will be their default view after login.1
●	The page will feature a Data Table component that displays all samples with a status of InLab or Testing.1
●	Implement client-side logic to apply row styling based on sample priority: a solid red background for STAT, and a yellow background for overdue samples.1
●	The table will be sortable and filterable by various fields like patient name, accession number, and test status.

Backend Development

●	Implement the GET /api/v1/worklist endpoint.2
●	The core logic of this endpoint is its query to the orders collection. The query must be constructed to return a list of samples, sorted first by priority ('STAT' before 'Routine') and then by receivedTimestamp (oldest first).2
●	The endpoint must support pagination to handle large volumes of samples efficiently.2

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint directly addresses the core pain points of the Lab Technician: high workload, stress, and the risk of burnout.3 A static, chronological list of tasks is inefficient and dangerous in a high-volume lab. By creating a worklist that is proactively prioritized by the system, LabWise transforms from a passive data repository into an active cognitive aid.1 It reduces the mental load on the technician, allowing them to focus their expertise on the analytical work itself, rather than on managing a complex to-do list. This feature is a direct investment in both operational efficiency and patient safety.

Acceptance Criteria

●	When a Technician logs in, they are directed to the worklist dashboard.
●	A newly accessioned STAT sample appears at the very top of the worklist with a red background.
●	Routine samples are listed below STAT samples, ordered by the time they were received.
●	The GET /api/v1/worklist API response correctly sorts samples by priority and then by time.2
●	The UI correctly applies the specified color-coding to rows based on priority.1
________________________________________
Sprint 7: Analytical Engine - Result Entry & Verification


Sprint Goal

To implement the core result management workflow, including the auto-verification of normal results and the intelligent flagging of abnormal results that require manual review, such as those failing a delta check.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-TEC-03: As a Lab Technician, I need the system to automatically flag and hold any patient result that fails a delta check... so that I am prompted to investigate.3
●	US-TEC-05: As a Lab Technician... I need the system's auto-verification rules to automatically release all results that are within normal limits... so that I can focus my attention exclusively on the abnormal and problematic results.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Develop the "Result Entry/Verification" screen. This view will display all tests for a given sample, with input fields for entering results.1
●	For results that fail a delta check, the UI will display a prominent flag icon and a modal window showing a side-by-side comparison of the current and previous results.1
●	Implement a "Verify" button that submits the results to the backend.
●	Create a separate "Auto-Verified" tab or view where technicians can see a log of results that the system processed automatically.1

Backend Development

●	Implement the POST /api/v1/results/verify endpoint.2
●	This endpoint's logic is the heart of the analytical engine:
○	For each incoming result, compare it against the snapshotted referenceRange to set the isAbnormal flag.2
○	Implement the delta check logic: retrieve the patient's most recent previous result for the same test and compare. If the change is outside a configurable threshold, add "DELTA_CHECK_FAILED" to the test's flags array.2
○	Implement the auto-verification rule: if a result is not abnormal, has no flags, and its associated QC has passed, automatically move its status to Verified.3
○	For results requiring manual review, update their status to AwaitingVerification. For results submitted from the UI, move their status to Verified and record the verifiedBy user and verifiedAt timestamp.2

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint delivers a massive leap in efficiency and safety. The 80/20 rule often applies in the lab, where a large percentage of results are normal and routine. By automating the verification of these results, the system frees up an enormous amount of technician time, allowing them to focus their expertise where it is most needed: on investigating abnormal, critical, or clinically improbable results.3 The delta check is a powerful safety net, catching potential errors like sample mix-ups or instrument interference before a dangerous result can be released.3 This dual strategy of automation and intelligent assistance is central to LabWise's value proposition.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A normal result submitted from an instrument (simulated) is automatically moved to the Verified state without user interaction.
●	A result that is significantly different from the patient's previous result is flagged in the database and held in the AwaitingVerification state.
●	The UI correctly displays the delta check flag and the comparison modal for a flagged result.1
●	A Technician can manually enter and verify a result, which correctly records their user ID and the timestamp in the database.2
●	A verified result cannot be modified by a user with the 'Technician' role.
________________________________________
Sprint 8: Quality & Maintenance - The Compliance Core


Sprint Goal

To build the digital tools necessary for maintaining and documenting CLIA compliance, including electronic Quality Control (QC) logs, interactive Levey-Jennings charts, and instrument maintenance records.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-TEC-04: As a Lab Technician, I need to be able to log all instrument maintenance activities, calibrations, and QC results directly into an electronic logbook within LabWise, so that a complete, auditable... record is maintained for CLIA compliance.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the "Quality Control" module, accessible to Technicians.1
●	Create a form for entering QC results for a specific instrument and test.1
●	Implement a charting component to display Levey-Jennings charts, plotting QC results over time against their statistical mean and standard deviations.1
●	Build the "Instruments" module, which will list all lab instruments. Each instrument will have a detail page with an electronic logbook for maintenance activities.1

Backend Development

●	Implement the full suite of CRUD API endpoints for the qcLogs and instruments collections.2
●	Develop the Westgard Rules Engine. This is a backend service that will analyze incoming QC results. If a rule violation is detected (e.g., two consecutive results are more than 2 standard deviations from the mean), the engine will flag the QC run as failed.1
●	When a QC run fails, the backend must place a hold on releasing any patient results associated with that run.1

Database Tasks

●	Create the instruments and qcLogs collections in MongoDB.2
●	Apply indexes to instrumentId and runTimestamp in the qcLogs collection for efficient querying and chart generation.2

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint delivers the core compliance functionality of LabWise. Meticulous QC and maintenance documentation is not optional; it is a legal requirement for any clinical laboratory.3 By digitizing these paper-based logs, LabWise makes the lab "inspection-ready" at all times. The automated Westgard Rules engine is a critical safety feature, preventing the release of patient results from an analytical run that may be inaccurate.1 This sprint provides the tools that allow the Lab Manager to confidently demonstrate quality and compliance to auditors.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A Technician can log a new maintenance event for a specific instrument.
●	A Technician can enter a new QC result, and it appears as a new point on the correct Levey-Jennings chart.
●	When a QC result is entered that violates a Westgard rule, the backend flags the run as failed in the qcLogs collection.
●	The system prevents the verification of any patient results associated with a failed QC run.
________________________________________
Sprint 9: Command Center - Operational Visibility


Sprint Goal

To deliver the real-time Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dashboard for the Lab Manager, providing an at-a-glance view of the laboratory's operational health.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-MGR-01: As a Lab Manager, I need a configurable, real-time dashboard that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average turnaround time... sample rejection rates... and instrument uptime, so that I can proactively identify and address operational bottlenecks.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the "KPI Dashboard" page, which will be the default view for the Manager persona.1
●	The dashboard will be a grid of customizable widgets, using charting libraries to display data.1
●	Implement widgets for:
○	Average Turnaround Time (Line Graph)1
○	Sample Rejection Rate by reason/site (Pie/Bar Charts)1
○	Instrument Status (Status Board)1
○	Current Staff Workload (Bar Chart)1
●	Each widget will be interactive, allowing the manager to click through to a more detailed report.1

Backend Development

●	Implement the GET /api/v1/reports/kpi endpoint.2
●	This endpoint will be complex, requiring the backend to perform aggregation queries on the orders and instruments collections to calculate the KPIs in real-time. For example:
○	Turnaround Time: Calculate the average difference between receivedTimestamp and verifiedAt across all recent orders.2
○	Rejection Rate: Aggregate samples where rejectionInfo exists, grouped by rejectionInfo.reason.2

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint provides the first major deliverable for the Lab Manager persona. While previous sprints built the transactional engine, this sprint builds the strategic oversight layer. A lab manager cannot fix problems they cannot see.3 By transforming raw transactional data into actionable insights, the KPI dashboard empowers the manager to move from a reactive to a proactive management style. They can spot trends, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to optimize workflows, staffing, and quality, directly impacting the lab's bottom line and quality of care.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A user logged in as a Manager sees the KPI dashboard as their home page.
●	The Turnaround Time widget accurately reflects the average time from sample receipt to verification.
●	The Rejection Rate widget correctly breaks down rejections by the reasons logged during the accessioning workflow.
●	The data on the dashboard updates in near real-time as new samples are processed.

Sprint 10: Command Center - Supply Chain Automation


Sprint Goal

To automate inventory management by implementing consumption tracking and proactive, automated alerts for low-stock items, preventing costly operational disruptions.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-MGR-02: As a Lab Manager, I need to receive an automated email and dashboard alert whenever the on-hand quantity for any inventory item... falls below its pre-defined minimum stock level, so that I can initiate a re-order with sufficient lead time.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the full "Inventory Management" module for the Manager.1
●	The UI will feature a Data Table of all inventory items, showing lot numbers, expiration dates, and quantity on hand.1
●	Implement forms for adding new inventory items and for setting the "par level" (minimum stock level) for each item.1
●	Add a "Low Stock Items" widget to the Manager's KPI dashboard.1

Backend Development

●	Implement the full suite of CRUD API endpoints for the /api/v1/inventory resource.2
●	Implement the automated consumption logic. This requires associating inventory items with specific tests in the testCatalog. When a test result is verified, a backend process will automatically decrement the quantityOnHand for the associated reagents in the inventoryItems collection.3
●	Create a scheduled job (e.g., a cron job) that runs periodically to check for any inventory items where quantityOnHand is below minStockLevel. If found, this job will trigger an email notification.3

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

A stock-out of a critical reagent can bring a whole section of the laboratory to a standstill, delaying patient diagnoses and costing the lab revenue.3 This sprint tackles that high-impact operational risk. By automating consumption tracking and reorder alerts, LabWise removes the potential for human error in a tedious manual process. This ensures operational continuity and allows the manager to focus on strategic tasks rather than constantly checking supply closets. It's a direct investment in the lab's operational resilience.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A Manager can add a new reagent to the inventory, specifying its lot number, expiration date, and initial quantity.
●	A Manager can set a minimum stock level for any inventory item.
●	When a technician verifies 10 "Glucose" tests, the system automatically decrements the quantity of the associated "Glucose Reagent Kit" in the inventory.
●	When the quantity of a reagent drops below its minimum stock level, the item appears in the "Low Stock Items" dashboard widget and the Manager receives an email alert.

Sprint 11: Command Center - Audit & Compliance


Sprint Goal

To deliver the on-demand audit trail generation tool and the personnel competency tracking module, completing the Lab Manager's compliance toolkit.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-MGR-03: As a Lab Manager, during an audit, I need to be able to instantly generate a comprehensive, end-to-end audit trail for any patient sample by entering its accession number.3
●	US-MGR-05: As a Lab Manager, I need the system to track and document employee competency assessments and training records, with automated reminders for annual requirements.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the "Audit Trail" page, featuring a search input for an accession number or patient MRN.1
●	When a search is performed, the UI will display a chronological, printable report of every action taken on that record, sourced from the auditLogs collection.1
●	Enhance the "User Management" page to include a section for uploading and tracking training documents and competency assessments for each employee.1
●	Implement UI elements to show upcoming expiration dates for certifications.1

Backend Development

●	Implement the GET /api/v1/audit-logs endpoint with powerful query parameters (userId, entityId, etc.).2
●	The endpoint logic will query the auditLogs collection and join data from the users collection to display user names instead of just IDs.2
●	Extend the users collection schema to include the trainingRecords array as specified in the Backend Specification.2
●	Update the /api/v1/users/{id} endpoint to allow for managing these training records.

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint delivers the final pieces of the "always inspection-ready" promise. The on-demand audit trail is a direct response to HIPAA's stringent logging requirements.3 The ability to produce a complete history of a patient record in seconds is a powerful tool during an audit. Similarly, managing personnel files is a critical but tedious part of CLIA compliance.3 By digitizing these records and adding automated reminders, LabWise reduces administrative overhead and ensures that the lab can always prove its staff are qualified and up-to-date on their training.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A Manager can enter a sample's accession number and view a complete, timestamped log of every user who accessed it and every action they took.
●	A Manager can upload a PDF of a training certificate to a technician's user profile and set an expiration date.
●	The system correctly logs all auditable actions (e.g., result verification, patient record modification) in the auditLogs collection with the correct user ID and timestamp.

Sprint 12: External Portals - Physician Report Access


Sprint Goal

To build the foundational features of the secure Referring Physician portal, enabling them to log in, view the status of their orders, and access final patient reports.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-PHY-02: As a Referring Physician, I need to be able to securely log into a web portal... to view the real-time status of all my pending patient orders and to access, view, and download their final PDF reports.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Create a separate entry point/application for the external portals with its own login page.
●	Build the Physician's dashboard, which will feature a Data Table listing their recent patient orders and the current status of each ('Sample in Lab', 'Testing in Progress', 'Final Report Ready').1
●	Implement a "View Report" action that allows the physician to view/download the final PDF report.

Backend Development

●	Implement the GET /api/v1/portal/orders endpoint. This endpoint must be rigorously secured to ensure a physician can only see orders where they are the ordering physician.2
●	Implement the GET /api/v1/portal/orders/{id} endpoint, which will return the detailed order information for the physician view.2
●	Develop a service for generating the final, formatted PDF report. This service will take the verified result data and render it into the clinically optimized report template defined in the UI/UX blueprint.1

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint opens up LabWise to its primary external clients. Providing physicians with direct, real-time access to order status and results solves one of their biggest pain points: uncertainty and communication delays.3 By offering a self-service portal, the lab can reduce the volume of inbound phone calls asking "Where is my patient's result?", freeing up lab staff time. This feature transforms the lab's relationship with its clients, making it a more transparent and efficient partner in patient care.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A user with the 'Physician' role can log in through the portal.
●	The physician's dashboard only displays patients that they have placed orders for.
●	An attempt by one physician to access another physician's order via the API results in a 403 Forbidden error.2
●	A physician can successfully download a PDF report for a completed order.

Sprint 13: External Portals - Physician Workflow Tools


Sprint Goal

To enhance the Physician Portal with tools that improve the ordering process and communication, including an online test catalog and a critical value alerting system.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-PHY-01: As a Referring Physician, I need access to a searchable, online test catalog... that provides clear, concise descriptions for each test, along with specimen requirements... so that I can confidently order the most appropriate test.3
●	US-PHY-03: As a Referring Physician, I need to receive an immediate, secure notification... whenever a critical value result... is reported for one of my patients, so that I can take immediate clinical action.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the "Online Test Catalog" page in the physician portal. This will be a searchable interface to the testCatalog collection, displaying test names, descriptions, specimen requirements, and turnaround times.1
●	Implement an "Action Required: Critical Value Alerts" inbox on the physician's dashboard. This will be a highly prominent UI element that displays any critical results requiring acknowledgment.1

Backend Development

●	Implement the critical value notification workflow. When a technician verifies a result and the system flags it as critical, the backend will trigger an asynchronous job.2
●	The asynchronous worker will send a secure notification (e.g., SMS via a third-party service) to the ordering physician and create an alert record linked to their user account.2
●	The API for the physician's dashboard will be updated to return these alert records.

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint delivers features that directly improve patient safety and reduce errors at the source. An online test catalog helps prevent physicians from ordering the wrong test or using the wrong collection tube, which is a common cause of rejected samples.3 The automated critical value alerting system is a mission-critical safety feature. It closes the communication loop on life-threatening results, ensuring the information is delivered to the physician as quickly as possible so they can take immediate clinical action.3

Acceptance Criteria

●	A physician can search the online test catalog and view the detailed specimen requirements for a test.
●	When a technician verifies a result that is flagged as critical in the database, the ordering physician receives an SMS notification.
●	The critical result appears in the "Action Required" inbox on the physician's dashboard.

Sprint 14: External Portals - Patient Empowerment


Sprint Goal

To launch the secure Patient Portal, providing patients with direct, understandable access to their own lab results in compliance with HIPAA regulations.

User Stories Implemented

●	US-PAT-01: As a Patient, I need to be able to securely register for and log into a patient portal, so that I can view and download my final lab reports.3
●	US-PAT-02: As a Patient, when I view my lab report... I need each test result to be accompanied by a brief, plain-language explanation... and a simple visual indicator... that shows where my result falls within the normal reference range.3

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Build the Patient Portal, including a secure registration and login process.
●	The main view will be a simple, chronological list of the patient's available lab reports.1
●	Develop the "Patient-Friendly Report" view. This is not just a PDF viewer. It will be a custom UI that renders each test result with its plain-language explanation and a visual gauge or bar showing the result relative to the normal range.1

Backend Development

●	Extend the testCatalog collection to include a patientFriendlyExplanation field for each test.
●	The GET /api/v1/portal/orders/{id} endpoint logic will be enhanced. When the request comes from a user with the 'Patient' role, the API will shape the response to include this patient-friendly data, creating the specific view model needed by the patient portal UI.2
●	The backend must enforce strict authorization, ensuring a patient can only ever access their own records.2

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint fulfills a key regulatory requirement (HIPAA's Patient Right of Access) and addresses a major source of patient anxiety and confusion.3 Presenting raw clinical data to patients is often unhelpful.3 By designing a report view specifically for a non-clinical audience, LabWise empowers patients to better understand their health. This feature transforms the lab report from a confusing document into an educational tool, fostering better patient engagement and a stronger relationship between the patient and the healthcare provider.

Acceptance Criteria

●	A user with the 'Patient' role can log into the patient portal.
●	The patient can only see lab reports associated with their own patient record.
●	The report view displays a simple explanation for each test (e.g., "Glucose: This test measures the amount of sugar in your blood.").
●	The report view includes a visual graphic that clearly indicates whether a result is low, normal, or high.1

Sprint 15: Global Polish - Internationalization


Sprint Goal

To refactor the entire application to support internationalization (i18n) and implement a full Right-to-Left (RTL) transformation to prepare LabWise for global markets.

Development Tasks


Frontend Development

●	Refactor all UI components to replace hardcoded text strings with keys that look up translations from language-specific resource files (e.g., en.json, ar.json).
●	Implement the CSS changes required for a full RTL layout, as specified in the UI/UX Design Blueprint.1 This includes:
○	Using logical properties (text-align: start, padding-inline-start) wherever possible.1
○	Manually flipping properties like border-radius and transforms where necessary.1
○	Mirroring the layout of complex components like data tables, charts, and calendars.1
○	Swapping directional icons (e.g., back/forward arrows) based on the current language direction.1

Backend Development

●	The backend API may need to be updated to serve localized content, such as error messages or data from the testCatalog, based on an Accept-Language header in the request.

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This sprint is scheduled late in the process after all core features have been built and stabilized. Retrofitting an application for i18n and RTL is significantly more difficult and error-prone than building it in from the start, but addressing it after the UI is complete allows the team to tackle the transformation holistically. This work is critical for expanding LabWise's addressable market beyond English-speaking, LTR regions. It is a strategic investment in the product's future scalability and global reach.

Acceptance Criteria

●	The application can be switched between English (LTR) and Arabic (RTL).
●	When in RTL mode, the navigation sidebar moves to the right, text is right-aligned, and all layout elements are correctly mirrored.1
●	Data tables correctly reverse their column order in RTL mode.1
●	All UI text is sourced from language resource files, with no hardcoded strings remaining in the components.

Sprint 16: End-to-End Validation & Hardening


Sprint Goal

To perform a full, end-to-end validation of all user journeys, optimize application performance, and conduct a final security audit before release. This is a "hardening" sprint focused on quality, stability, and security rather than new features.

Development Tasks


Frontend & Backend Development

●	Performance Optimization: Profile the application to identify and fix performance bottlenecks. This includes optimizing database queries, implementing code splitting in the frontend to reduce initial load times, and caching frequently accessed data.
●	End-to-End Testing: Execute the key user journeys defined in the UI/UX blueprint as full, end-to-end tests.1 This involves simulating the entire sample lifecycle, from a Receptionist creating an order to a Physician viewing the final report, to validate that all integrations between modules are working correctly.
●	Security Audit: Conduct a thorough security review. This includes static code analysis, dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities, and penetration testing to identify and remediate potential security flaws in the authentication, authorization, and data handling layers.
●	Bug Fixing: Address any remaining bugs identified during the development and testing phases, prioritizing those that impact core functionality or security.

Rationale and Strategic Sequencing

This final sprint before launch is a critical quality gate. While previous sprints focused on delivering vertical slices of functionality, this sprint looks at the system as a complete, integrated whole. The goal is to ensure that the application is not just functional but also performant, reliable, and secure. Dedicating a full sprint to this hardening process ensures that the product delivered to the first customer is of the highest possible quality, building trust and setting the foundation for future success.

Acceptance Criteria

●	All critical database queries execute below a defined performance threshold.
●	The application's initial load time is below a target value (e.g., 3 seconds).
●	The complete sample lifecycle user journey can be executed without errors.
●	The application passes a security audit with no high-severity vulnerabilities remaining.
●	The final bug backlog is cleared of all critical and high-priority issues.
