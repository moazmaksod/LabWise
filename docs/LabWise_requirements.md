LabWise: Business Requirements Document


Executive Summary

This document specifies the business, functional, and non-functional requirements for LabWise, a next-generation Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Its purpose is to serve as the foundational blueprint for the design, development, and implementation of the system, ensuring it meets the complex operational needs of a modern clinical laboratory.
The contemporary clinical laboratory operates under immense pressure. It is expected to handle escalating test volumes and a wider variety of assays with static or shrinking staff levels.1 This environment is further complicated by significant staffing shortages and the need to adhere to a stringent regulatory landscape, including the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).2 The ultimate mandate is to produce rapid, reliable, and reproducible results, as clinical decisions and patient outcomes depend on their accuracy and timeliness.1 Analysis of laboratory operations reveals that the majority of critical errors do not occur during the highly automated analytical testing phase. Instead, they arise in the human-centric pre-analytical and post-analytical stages, which include patient registration, sample collection, data entry, and the communication of results.4
LabWise is conceived as an end-to-end, persona-driven LIMS engineered to mitigate these specific challenges. The system will automate and streamline the entire sample lifecycle, from the initial test order to the final archiving of the report. By implementing intelligent workflows, robust validation rules, and seamless instrument integration, LabWise will minimize the potential for manual error at every touchpoint. It will provide laboratory managers with actionable, real-time insights into operational performance, enabling proactive quality management and resource optimization. The system's core design will be grounded in ensuring unwavering compliance with all regulatory standards through built-in controls, comprehensive audit trails, and state-of-the-art security protocols.
The successful implementation of LabWise will be measured against the following key objectives:
●	A reduction in pre-analytical and post-analytical errors by a target of 50%.
●	An improvement in average sample turnaround time (TAT) by a target of 25%.
●	The complete automation of inventory management processes to eliminate stock-out events of critical reagents and consumables.
●	The delivery of a seamless, intuitive, and role-specific user experience for all laboratory personnel, as well as for external stakeholders such as referring physicians and patients.
●	Guaranteed 100% compliance with HIPAA and CLIA regulations through systematically integrated and auditable system controls.

The LabWise Operational Ecosystem: An End-to-End Perspective

To build a system that effectively serves a clinical laboratory, it is essential to first understand the complete operational context. The laboratory is not merely a place where tests are run; it is a complex ecosystem through which physical samples and digital information flow in parallel. LabWise must be architected to manage and harmonize these two lifecycles. The entire workflow can be logically segmented into three distinct phases, a structure that is fundamental to laboratory science and will serve as the architectural foundation for the LabWise system.6
A critical understanding that must inform the system's design priorities is that these phases do not carry equal risk. The analytical phase, characterized by sophisticated and highly automated instrumentation, accounts for less than 10% of all laboratory errors.5 The vast majority of mistakes, including those with the most severe clinical consequences, occur at the beginning and end of the process: the pre-analytical and post-analytical phases.4 These stages are defined by human interaction—patient identification, manual data entry, specimen handling, and the communication of complex results. Therefore, LabWise's primary value is not simply in automating testing, but in systematically error-proofing the human touchpoints that bracket the automated core. This principle dictates a focus on features that enforce data validation, leverage barcode scanning to eliminate ambiguity, and automate critical communications to ensure patient safety.

The Three Phases of Laboratory Testing


Pre-Analytical Phase

This initial phase encompasses all processes from the moment a test is ordered until the sample is ready for analysis. It is the most vulnerable stage for errors that can compromise a specimen's integrity or link it to the wrong patient.4 LabWise's role in this phase is to act as a vigilant gatekeeper.
●	Patient Registration & Order Entry: The workflow begins with the capture of patient demographic data, insurance information, and the specific tests ordered by a physician. This requires meticulous data entry, as a single mistake can cascade through the entire process.7
●	Sample Collection & Labeling: At the point of collection, the sample must be unequivocally linked to the patient and the corresponding order. This is typically achieved by generating unique, barcoded labels that are affixed to the sample containers.9
●	Sample Transportation & Accessioning: The labeled sample is transported to the laboratory. Upon arrival, it is "accessioned"—a formal process where the sample's arrival is logged, its condition is verified (e.g., checking for proper temperature, visible integrity), and it is officially entered into the laboratory's workflow, receiving a unique internal tracking number.6

Analytical Phase

This is the core testing phase where the actual measurement of analytes occurs. Efficiency and accuracy in this stage are driven by instrumentation and automation.1 LabWise must seamlessly integrate with and orchestrate these automated processes.
●	Sample Processing: Depending on the test, samples may require preparatory steps. This can include centrifugation to separate plasma or serum, aliquoting (dividing a primary sample into smaller tubes for different tests), or dilution if a result is expected to be outside the instrument's measurement range.6
●	Testing & Analysis: The prepared sample is introduced to an analyzer or subjected to a manual testing procedure. The instrument performs the analysis and generates a raw data result.6
●	Quality Control (QC): Before, during, or after patient samples are tested, the laboratory runs quality control samples—materials with known values. This process validates that the instruments and reagents are performing correctly. Patient results cannot be considered valid unless the associated QC results are within acceptable limits.6

Post-Analytical Phase

This final phase involves the transformation of raw data into a final, clinically actionable report and ensuring it reaches the correct recipient. Errors in this stage often relate to data interpretation and communication.13
●	Result Verification & Validation: A qualified lab professional reviews the test results. This involves checking them against established reference ranges, comparing them to the patient's previous results (a "delta check"), and ensuring the associated QC was acceptable. This is the final checkpoint for analytical accuracy.15
●	Report Generation: The validated results are compiled into a formal report. A well-designed report presents data clearly, highlights abnormal values, and may include interpretive comments to aid the physician.17
●	Report Delivery: The final report is securely transmitted to the ordering physician, typically via an interface to their Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. Under HIPAA, patients also have a right to access their results, often facilitated through a secure patient portal.15
●	Sample Archiving & Disposal: After testing is complete, samples are stored for a defined period. This allows for re-testing or add-on testing if required. Following this period, they are disposed of according to biohazard waste protocols.13

The Complete Lifecycle of a Patient Sample

To conceptualize LabWise's function, it is useful to follow the journey of a single sample. Consider a blood vial drawn for a Complete Blood Count (CBC).
1.	A physician places an order for a CBC in their EHR, which is transmitted to LabWise.
2.	At the collection site, a receptionist registers the patient in LabWise, which prints barcoded labels.
3.	A phlebotomist collects the blood into a lavender-top tube, applies the label, and scans it to confirm collection time.
4.	A courier transports the sample to the lab. A technician at the accessioning station scans the tube's barcode. LabWise confirms the order, assigns a unique accession number, and adds the test to the hematology worklist.
5.	The sample is placed on an automated track, which routes it to the hematology analyzer.12
6.	The analyzer aspirates the sample, performs the CBC, and transmits the raw results back to LabWise.
7.	LabWise receives the results, applies auto-verification rules (checking against reference ranges and delta checks), and flags them as ready for review.
8.	A medical technologist reviews the results on their screen, confirms the associated QC was in-range, and electronically signs off, releasing the results.
9.	LabWise formats the final report and electronically transmits it to the ordering physician's EHR.
10.	The system logs the sample's location as it is moved to a refrigerated storage rack for its 7-day retention period.
11.	After 7 days, LabWise flags the sample for disposal on a system-generated worksheet.
Throughout this entire journey, from collection to disposal, LabWise maintains a complete, unbroken digital chain of custody and data integrity.9

The Flow of Information

The physical journey of the sample is mirrored by a critical, parallel journey of digital information. The integrity of this data flow is the bedrock of the laboratory's credibility and is a primary focus of regulatory frameworks like HIPAA.3 A failure in the information lifecycle—such as a mismatched patient ID or a report sent to the wrong physician—is as catastrophic as a lost or contaminated sample. This reality underscores the necessity of designing LabWise with a "data-first" principle, where every feature is assessed based on its contribution to the accuracy, security, and traceability of the information it manages. The audit trail is not merely a compliance feature; it is the system's core ledger of its own trustworthiness.
●	Data Inputs: LabWise must ingest data from multiple sources. This includes patient demographic data from a hospital's central registration system (HIS), test orders from external physician EHRs, and raw numerical or qualitative data from dozens of different analytical instruments.8
●	Data Processing: Internally, LabWise is the central processing unit. It links patient identifiers to sample accession numbers, applies complex QC rules, performs calculations, flags results based on defined criteria (e.g., critical values), and formats data for final reporting.
●	Data Outputs: The system must securely push data to various endpoints. Finalized reports are sent to EHR systems, billing codes and diagnostic information are transmitted to revenue cycle management (RCM) platforms, and anonymized, aggregated data is made available to internal analytics modules for operational oversight and quality improvement initiatives.8

User Personas and Role-Based Functional Requirements

A successful LIMS must be designed with a deep understanding of the diverse individuals who will interact with it daily. Each user has a unique set of responsibilities, goals, and frustrations. A persona-driven approach ensures that LabWise's features are not developed in a vacuum but are tailored to solve specific, real-world problems for each user group. The needs of these personas are often interconnected, creating feedback loops that a well-designed system can either improve or exacerbate.
For example, a common negative cycle begins when a referring physician experiences slow turnaround times for routine tests.23 To compensate, the physician may begin ordering tests with a "STAT" (urgent) priority for convenience rather than true medical necessity.23 This creates a "STAT overload" in the laboratory, overwhelming technicians and creating a processing bottleneck.24 The resulting stress and high workload increase the risk of error and burnout for the lab staff.2 Ironically, this bottleneck delays both the routine tests
and the truly urgent STAT requests, worsening the physician's original problem. LabWise cannot be a passive observer in this dynamic. It must be an active mediator, incorporating rule-based logic to break such cycles. For instance, the system can be configured to require physicians to select a specific clinical justification for a STAT order. This data allows the Lab Manager to identify patterns of misuse and engage in data-driven conversations with clinics to improve test utilization, transforming LabWise from a simple information system into a tool for process improvement.
The following table provides a high-level overview of the key stakeholders, their objectives, and the primary pain points that LabWise is designed to address.

The Front Desk / Receptionist Persona

Profile: The receptionist is the initial point of contact and the gateway to the laboratory workflow. They are responsible for accurately capturing all patient demographic, insurance, and billing information, as well as transcribing the physician's test orders. The integrity of the entire laboratory process hinges on the accuracy of their work, as errors at this stage can lead to misidentified samples, incorrect billing, or delayed results.26
Pain Points: The role is often characterized by high pressure and repetitive tasks. Key frustrations include manually typing information from paper requisitions or ID cards, which is prone to error; spending significant time on the phone with insurance companies to verify coverage details; managing the flow of scheduled and walk-in patients; and dealing with incomplete or illegible information provided on physician order forms.7
User Stories:
●	US-REC-01: As a Receptionist, I need to scan a patient's driver's license and insurance card using a simple 2D barcode scanner, so that the system automatically populates the patient's name, address, DOB, and insurance policy information into the registration fields, thereby minimizing typographical errors and reducing patient check-in time.
●	US-REC-02: As a Receptionist, I need the system to perform a real-time insurance eligibility and benefits check via an electronic interface when I enter a patient's policy number, so that I can immediately inform the patient of their estimated co-payment or deductible and collect it at the time of service.
●	US-REC-03: As a Receptionist, I need to access a clear, color-coded calendar view of available phlebotomy appointments, so that I can efficiently schedule new patients, manage walk-ins by identifying open slots, and reschedule existing appointments with a simple drag-and-drop interface.
●	US-REC-04: As a Receptionist, when entering a test order, I need the system to present a smart search field that suggests tests as I type, and which requires a corresponding ICD-10 diagnosis code from a searchable list, so that I can ensure a complete and billable order is created.

The Lab Technician Persona

Profile: The lab technician is the heart of the laboratory's analytical engine. They are highly skilled professionals responsible for the entire testing process, from receiving and preparing samples to operating complex instrumentation, performing quality control, and verifying test results. They work in a fast-paced, high-stress environment where precision and attention to detail are non-negotiable.32
Pain Points: The daily challenges for a lab technician are immense. They often face long hours and a high-volume workload under tight deadlines, leading to significant stress and a high risk of burnout.25 The potential for a single mistake, such as a sample mix-up or a data entry error, carries severe consequences for patient safety, creating constant pressure. Other frustrations include dealing with poorly collected or labeled samples from external sites, troubleshooting complex instrument failures, and performing repetitive manual tasks that could be automated.27
User Stories:
●	US-TEC-01: As a Lab Technician, I need to be able to scan a sample's barcode at any workstation, so that the system immediately displays the patient's identity, the tests ordered for that specific sample, and any special handling notes, thereby eliminating the risk of performing the wrong test on the wrong sample.
●	US-TEC-02: As a Lab Technician, I need my home screen to be a dynamic, real-time worklist that automatically prioritizes samples, clearly flagging STAT requests in red, overdue samples in yellow, and samples pending QC approval, so that I can effectively manage my workload and address the most critical tasks first.
●	US-TEC-03: As a Lab Technician, I need the system to automatically flag and hold any patient result that fails a delta check (e.g., a potassium result of 7.0 mmol/L for a patient whose result was 4.1 mmol/L yesterday), so that I am prompted to investigate a potential pre-analytical error or instrument issue before releasing a clinically improbable and potentially dangerous result.
●	US-TEC-04: As a Lab Technician, I need to be able to log all instrument maintenance activities, calibrations, and QC results directly into an electronic logbook within LabWise, so that a complete, auditable, and easily searchable record is maintained for CLIA compliance and troubleshooting purposes.
●	US-TEC-05: As a Lab Technician, when an instrument transmits a result, I need the system's auto-verification rules to automatically release all results that are within normal limits, have passed all QC checks, and have no delta flags, so that I can focus my attention exclusively on the abnormal and problematic results that require manual review.

The Lab Manager Persona

Profile: The lab manager is the operational, administrative, and strategic leader of the laboratory. They are responsible for a wide array of functions including overall quality assurance, resource management (staffing and inventory), financial oversight, and ensuring the laboratory remains in a constant state of compliance with regulatory bodies like CLIA and accrediting agencies like the College of American Pathologists (CAP).28
Pain Points: Lab managers often struggle with a lack of real-time, high-level visibility into their operations. They may only learn about bottlenecks or inefficiencies after they have already impacted turnaround times. Managing the supply chain for hundreds of reagents and consumables to prevent costly stock-outs is a constant challenge.28 Furthermore, they bear the ultimate responsibility for being "inspection-ready" at all times, which requires meticulous documentation and the ability to produce any record an auditor might request on a moment's notice.28
User Stories:
●	US-MGR-01: As a Lab Manager, I need a configurable, real-time dashboard that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average turnaround time by test and priority, sample rejection rates by collection site, instrument uptime, and current staff workload, so that I can proactively identify and address operational bottlenecks before they become critical.
●	US-MGR-02: As a Lab Manager, I need to receive an automated email and dashboard alert whenever the on-hand quantity for any inventory item, such as 'Reagent Kit XYZ', falls below its pre-defined minimum stock level, so that I can initiate a re-order with sufficient lead time to prevent a stock-out.
●	US-MGR-03: As a Lab Manager, during an audit, I need to be able to instantly generate a comprehensive, end-to-end audit trail for any patient sample by entering its accession number, which details every user who accessed it, every action they took (e.g., viewed, modified, printed), and a precise timestamp for each event, so that I can demonstrate full compliance with HIPAA and CLIA requirements.
●	US-MGR-04: As a Lab Manager, I need a centralized administrative module to manage user accounts and define role-based permissions, so that I can ensure that receptionists cannot verify lab results and technicians cannot modify billing information, thereby enforcing the principle of least privilege.
●	US-MGR-05: As a Lab Manager, I need the system to track and document employee competency assessments and training records, with automated reminders for annual requirements, so that I can ensure all personnel records are complete and up-to-date for inspections.

The Referring Physician Persona

Profile: The referring physician is the laboratory's primary external client. They depend on the lab to provide accurate and timely data that is fundamental to their process of diagnosing, treating, and monitoring patients. Their interaction with the lab is a critical node in the patient care continuum.29
Pain Points: Physicians frequently experience uncertainty and frustration when interacting with laboratories. This includes difficulty in ordering the correct test due to ambiguous test names or complex test panels, and a lack of transparency regarding the cost to the patient or insurance coverage restrictions.29 Their most significant frustrations, however, are process-related: not receiving test results in a timely manner and receiving final reports that are poorly formatted, cluttered, and difficult to quickly interpret, which can delay critical clinical decisions.29
User Stories:
●	US-PHY-01: As a Referring Physician, I need access to a searchable, online test catalog within a secure portal that provides clear, concise descriptions for each test, along with specimen requirements, collection instructions, and expected turnaround times, so that I can confidently order the most appropriate test for my patient's clinical presentation.
●	US-PHY-02: As a Referring Physician, I need to be able to securely log into a web portal from my office or mobile device to view the real-time status of all my pending patient orders and to access, view, and download their final PDF reports the moment they are released by the laboratory.
●	US-PHY-03: As a Referring Physician, I need to receive an immediate, secure notification via SMS text message and an alert in my portal inbox whenever a critical value result (e.g., a dangerously high potassium level) is reported for one of my patients, so that I can take immediate clinical action to ensure their safety.
●	US-PHY-04: As a Referring Physician, I need patient reports to be presented in a clean, intuitive format that uses graphical elements to trend key results over time and color-coding to clearly highlight any values that fall outside the normal reference range, so that I can quickly assess the clinical significance of the results.

The Patient Persona

Profile: The patient is the ultimate stakeholder in the laboratory process. Under HIPAA regulations, they have a legal right to access their own protected health information (PHI), including their laboratory test reports.19 Empowering patients with direct access to their data supports their engagement in their own healthcare.
Pain Points: Historically, patients have faced significant barriers to obtaining their lab results, often having to wait for a follow-up appointment or make multiple phone calls. When they do receive reports, they are typically designed for clinicians and are filled with technical jargon, abbreviations, and numerical data without context, making them confusing and anxiety-provoking.19
User Stories:
●	US-PAT-01: As a Patient, I need to be able to securely register for and log into a patient portal, so that I can view and download my final lab reports at my convenience, allowing me to maintain a complete personal health record.
●	US-PAT-02: As a Patient, when I view my lab report in the portal, I need each test result to be accompanied by a brief, plain-language explanation of what the test measures (e.g., "Glucose measures the amount of sugar in your blood") and a simple visual indicator, like a colored bar, that shows where my result falls within the normal reference range, so that I can better understand my health status.

Core System Modules and Features

LabWise will be architected as a series of interconnected modules, each addressing a specific phase or function of the laboratory workflow. These modules are not independent silos; they are deeply integrated components of a cohesive system. An action performed in one module must intelligently trigger corresponding processes and data updates in others. For example, when a lab technician completes an analytical run, the system must simultaneously:
1.	Decrement the associated reagents from the Inventory Module.
2.	Log the results and compare them against patient history in the Patient and Order Management Module.
3.	Validate the run against data in the Quality Control Module.
4.	If a result is critical, trigger an alert via the Reporting and Analytics Module.
5.	Record every one of these automated and manual steps in the system-wide Audit Trail.
This interconnectedness defines the system as a state machine, where the sample is the central object. The sample's current state (e.g., 'Awaiting Collection', 'In-Lab', 'Testing in Progress', 'Result Verified') dictates the available user actions and triggers automated workflows across the entire platform. This architectural principle is fundamental to creating a robust, intelligent, and error-resistant LIMS.

Patient and Order Management

This module serves as the system's foundational data repository, establishing the correct patient and test information before any physical sample processing begins. Its accuracy is paramount to the integrity of the entire workflow.
Requirements:
●	Patient Record Management: The system must support a comprehensive patient record containing all required demographic and contact fields (e.g., Full Name, Date of Birth, Medical Record Number (MRN), Address, Phone).7 It must include functionality for searching for existing patients to prevent the creation of duplicates and provide an administrative tool for merging verified duplicate records.
●	Test Catalog Management: A core administrative function allowing the Lab Manager to build and maintain the laboratory's entire menu of tests. This catalog must be highly flexible, supporting:
○	Single Tests: (e.g., Glucose).
○	Complex Panels: Pre-defined groups of tests that are ordered together (e.g., Basic Metabolic Panel, which includes Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, etc.).8
○	Rules-Based Reflex Testing: The ability to configure automated, conditional logic. For example, a rule can be set: "IF a patient's TSH result is > 4.5 mIU/L, THEN automatically add a 'Free T4' test to the order using the same sample".8 This automates best practices and improves diagnostic efficiency.
●	Order Entry Interface: The system must provide an intuitive interface for both internal staff (Receptionists) and external users (Physicians via portal) to create new test orders.36 This interface must feature a powerful search function for the test catalog and enforce the selection of an appropriate diagnosis code (ICD-10) for medical necessity and billing. Crucially, it must include built-in validation to prevent logical errors, such as ordering a test that cannot be performed on the specified sample type.
●	Requisition and Label Generation: The system must be capable of printing standardized collection lists, packing lists, and patient-specific requisitions that include barcodes for the order and the patient, ensuring positive identification at the point of collection.36

Sample Tracking and Management

This module is the digital guardian of the physical sample. It governs the entire lifecycle of the sample within the laboratory's four walls, creating an immutable chain of custody from receipt to disposal.
Requirements:
●	Accessioning: This is the formal process of receiving a sample into the laboratory. Upon scanning the requisition or sample barcode, the system must assign a unique, sequential accession number that will serve as the primary internal identifier for that sample for its entire lifecycle.6
●	Barcode-Driven Workflow: All significant movements and actions involving a sample must be recorded via a barcode scan. This includes receiving the sample at accessioning, loading it onto an instrument, placing it into a storage location, retrieving it from storage, and finally, discarding it. The user interface for these functions must be optimized for high-throughput environments, allowing for rapid, sequential scanning with minimal clicks.
●	Chain of Custody Log: Every barcode scan must be recorded in a secure, immutable log. Each log entry must contain a minimum data set: the unique sample ID, the action performed (e.g., 'Stored', 'Analyzed'), the location/instrument involved, the user ID of the operator, and a precise, system-generated timestamp.
●	Storage Management: The system must include a configurable and visual module for managing physical storage locations. Administrators must be able to define a hierarchy of storage units (e.g., buildings, rooms, freezers, racks, boxes, positions). Users must be able to scan a sample's barcode and instantly see its precise location (e.g., Freezer -80C, Rack 5, Box C, Position 3), and conversely, view a graphical representation of a box to see all samples stored within it.

Quality Control (QC) and Assurance

This module is the scientific conscience of the laboratory. It provides the tools to ensure analytical accuracy and is a cornerstone of meeting CLIA regulatory requirements.4
Requirements:
●	QC Material and Lot Management: The system must allow the Lab Manager to define all QC materials used in the lab, including their names, lot numbers, expiration dates, and the statistically defined target ranges (mean and standard deviation) for each analyte.4
●	Levey-Jennings Charts: For each test and QC level, the system must automatically plot control results on a Levey-Jennings chart. This graphical representation is essential for visually identifying trends, shifts, or increased randomness in test performance over time.5
●	Westgard Rules Engine: The system must include a configurable rules engine to automatically apply Westgard multirule QC procedures to control data as it is generated.37 When a rule is violated (e.g., a 1-3s or 2-2s rule failure), the system must automatically flag the analytical run as "out of control." This action must, by default, prevent the release of any patient results associated with that failed run.
●	Corrective Action Documentation: Following a QC failure, the system must provide a structured workflow for technicians to document their troubleshooting process. This includes recording the nature of the problem, the corrective action taken (e.g., 'recalibrated instrument', 'opened new vial of reagent'), and the results of the subsequent, successful QC run. This documentation is a critical requirement for laboratory inspections.4

Inventory and Reagent Management

Effective inventory management is crucial for uninterrupted laboratory operations. A stock-out of a single critical reagent can halt testing for a specific analyte, delaying patient care and causing significant operational disruption.28 LabWise will automate this process to ensure continuity.
Requirements:
●	Item Catalog: The system will feature a comprehensive catalog for all laboratory consumables, including reagents, calibrators, controls, and disposable supplies. Each item entry will include details such as vendor, part number, storage requirements (e.g., refrigerated, frozen), and hazard classification.38
●	Lot Number and Expiration Tracking: All inventory items must be tracked by their specific lot number and expiration date upon receipt. The system must be configured to enforce a "First-In, First-Out" (FIFO) usage policy, prompting users to select the oldest stock first to minimize waste due to expiration.38
●	Automated Consumption Decrementing: The system will allow managers to associate specific inventory items with specific tests. When a technician records the completion of a test or a batch of tests, LabWise will automatically decrement the associated reagents from the on-hand inventory count.
●	Automated Reorder Alerts: For each inventory item, the Lab Manager must be able to define a "par level" or minimum stock quantity. When automated decrementing causes the on-hand quantity to fall below this threshold, the system must automatically generate a reorder notification, sent via email or dashboard alert to the Lab Manager and purchasing staff.38

Reporting and Analytics

This module is responsible for transforming raw analytical data into clear, actionable information for both clinicians and laboratory management.
Requirements:
●	Customizable Report Templates: The system must include a powerful, user-friendly report designer tool. This will allow the Lab Manager (or other designated super-user) to create, modify, and manage the visual layout of final patient reports. This includes the ability to add the laboratory's logo, configure test-specific reference ranges (e.g., different ranges for pediatric vs. adult patients), and add canned or free-text interpretive comments.17
●	Graphical Result Trending: For quantitative results, patient reports must automatically include a historical trend graph that plots the current result alongside previous results for the same analyte. This provides immediate clinical context and allows physicians to instantly visualize changes over time.17
●	Operational Dashboards: The system will provide real-time, configurable dashboards tailored to the Lab Manager persona, displaying the KPIs detailed in their user stories (e.g., TAT, rejection rates).28
●	Audit and Compliance Reporting: The system must provide one-click generation of reports specifically required for regulatory inspections. Examples include a complete chain of custody report for a specific sample, a log of all corrected reports issued within a given date range, and a summary of all QC failures and corrective actions for a specific instrument.

Managing Exceptions, Emergencies, and Non-Standard Workflows

A laboratory's workflow is rarely linear. The true test of a LIMS is not how it handles routine operations, but how it manages the inevitable exceptions, emergencies, and deviations from the standard process. These "edge cases" are where poorly designed systems fail, leading to errors, delays, and compliance risks. LabWise will be designed with dedicated, robust workflows to handle these non-standard scenarios, transforming them from potential crises into controlled, documented processes.
The data generated by these exception workflows is invaluable. It is not merely a record of a problem but a rich source of information for process improvement. For instance, every sample rejection is an operational event.41 By systematically logging the reason for every rejection (e.g., QNS, hemolyzed, mislabeled) and its source (e.g., Clinic A, Phlebotomist B), LabWise creates a powerful dataset. The Lab Manager can then use the analytics module to identify trends, such as a disproportionately high rate of hemolyzed samples coming from a specific clinic. Armed with this objective data, the manager can initiate targeted re-training with that clinic's staff. This proactive intervention, driven by data captured during a "failed" workflow, prevents future errors, reduces the costs associated with sample recollection, and ultimately improves patient care. This ability to turn exceptions into actionable intelligence is a core design principle of LabWise.

STAT (Urgent Request) Protocol

STAT tests, derived from the Latin statim (immediately), are ordered for medical emergencies where the result is needed for immediate patient management.42 The system must enforce the highest priority for these requests at every stage of the workflow.42
Workflow:
1.	Prioritized Ordering: When a physician or receptionist places a STAT order, the system will flag it with the highest priority. To mitigate the overuse of this designation for convenience, the system will be configurable to require the user to select a clinical justification from a predefined list (e.g., 'Emergency Department Patient', 'Post-operative Cardiac Arrhythmia').23
2.	Immediate Notification: The moment a STAT sample is accessioned in the lab, the system will trigger an immediate, multi-modal alert to the relevant testing department. This will include a persistent on-screen pop-up on the technician's worklist and an audible chime to ensure the request is not missed.
3.	Worklist and Automation Prioritization: The STAT sample will automatically appear at the very top of the technician's digital worklist, highlighted in a distinct color (e.g., red).12 For laboratories with total laboratory automation, the system will instruct the track to physically route the STAT sample into a priority lane, allowing it to bypass routine samples.12
4.	Expedited Reporting: Once the result is technically verified, it is automatically flagged as a STAT and potentially critical value. The system will immediately initiate the critical value notification workflow, ensuring the result is communicated to the physician without delay.42

Sample Rejection Protocol

To ensure the analytical quality and clinical validity of results, the laboratory must have a strict, documented policy for rejecting specimens that are unsuitable for testing.41 LabWise will digitize, enforce, and document this critical quality assurance process.
Workflow:
1.	Problem Identification: At the point of accessioning, a technician identifies a problem with a received sample (e.g., the specimen is hemolyzed, the volume is insufficient for the tests ordered, it was received in the wrong type of tube, or the label is illegible).
2.	Rejection Action in LIS: The technician selects the sample in LabWise and initiates a "Reject Sample" action.
3.	Mandatory Documentation: This action will trigger a mandatory pop-up form. The technician must select a specific reason for rejection from a customizable, standardized list derived from best practices. The form will also require the technician to document who was notified of the rejection (e.g., 'Nurse Jane Doe, ED'), the method of notification (e.g., 'Phone Call'), and the date/time of the notification.
4.	Automated Notification: Upon submission of the rejection form, the system will automatically send a secure electronic notification to the ordering physician's portal or EHR. This notification will clearly state that the sample was rejected, the reason for the rejection, and that a new sample is required.
5.	Data Logging and Auditing: The rejection event, including the reason and all notification details, is permanently recorded in the sample's immutable audit trail. The rejection reason is also logged as a discrete data point for trend analysis in the analytics module.
The following table outlines common rejection criteria and the corresponding system actions that will be configurable within LabWise. This transforms a subjective decision into a standardized, auditable procedure.

Rejection Criterion	Definition	System Action	Allowable Exceptions
Unlabeled/Mislabeled Specimen	Specimen has no label, or the label information does not match the requisition form with at least two unique patient identifiers.44	Reject sample. Log event. Notify provider and request recollect.	For "precious" or irreplaceable samples (e.g., CSF, tissue biopsy), the system will allow processing but will require documentation of who verified the sample's identity and will append a mandatory comment to the final report stating the initial condition.46
Insufficient Quantity (QNS)	The volume of the specimen is not enough to perform all ordered tests.44	Reject sample. Log event and reason. Notify provider and request recollect.	If enough sample exists for some but not all tests, the system will allow the technician to contact the provider for prioritization and cancel the remaining tests.
Hemolysis	Visible pink or red coloration of serum/plasma due to red blood cell lysis, which interferes with many chemistry tests.44	Reject sample. Log event and reason. Notify provider and request recollect.	The system will allow configuration of test-specific rules. For example, a sample may be rejected for a Potassium test but could be run for other tests (with a comment) if approved by a pathologist.
Improper Container/Tube Type	Specimen was collected in a tube with the wrong anticoagulant or preservative (e.g., blood for coagulation testing in a serum tube).44	Reject sample. Log event and reason. Notify provider and request recollect.	None. This is a critical error.
Exceeded Stability	The time between collection and receipt in the lab exceeds the established stability limits for a particular analyte (e.g., ammonia sample not on ice).46	Reject sample. Log event and reason. Notify provider and request recollect.	None. Results would be clinically invalid.

Test Re-run and Reflex Testing Protocol

This protocol defines the system's logic for handling situations that require a test to be repeated or for additional, follow-up tests to be automatically initiated.
Workflow:
●	Quality Control (QC) Failure: As defined in Section 3.3, a QC rule failure will automatically place a hold on the entire analytical run. Patient results from this run will be locked and cannot be released. The system will guide the technician through documenting the corrective action. Once the issue is resolved and a new QC run passes, the system will unlock the ability to re-run the affected patient samples.37
●	Delta Check Failure: When the system flags a result as clinically improbable based on the patient's historical data, the result will be held in a "Pending Review" status. The technician's interface will highlight this result and require a secondary action. Based on their permissions and laboratory policy, they can either initiate a re-run of the sample, release the result with a mandatory comment acknowledging the delta check failure, or escalate it to a supervisor for review.
●	Manual Re-run Request: A user with the appropriate permissions (e.g., Technician, Supervisor) can manually order a re-run on any sample that is still in storage and viable. This action will require the user to select a reason for the re-run from a dropdown list (e.g., 'Confirm abnormal result', 'Physician request', 'Suspected instrument error'), which is then logged in the audit trail.
●	Automated Reflex Testing: The rules for reflex testing will be configured by the Lab Manager within the Test Catalog module. When a patient's result meets the criteria for a pre-defined rule (e.g., "IF initial HIV screen is 'Reactive'"), LabWise will automatically add the confirmatory test to the order, place it on the appropriate worklist, and utilize the original sample without any manual intervention.

System-Wide, Non-Functional Requirements

These requirements define the essential quality attributes, constraints, and standards that the LabWise system must adhere to. They are not specific features but are overarching principles that govern the entire system's architecture, security, and performance. Failure to meet these non-functional requirements would represent a failure of the project, regardless of how well the functional features are implemented.

Regulatory Compliance and Security

LabWise will be deployed within the United States healthcare environment and must be designed from its foundation to ensure strict compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations. This is a non-negotiable, foundational requirement.

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)

The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules mandate the protection of all individually identifiable health information, known as Protected Health Information (PHI). LabWise must incorporate the following controls:
●	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The system must enforce the "minimum necessary" standard. Each user's access to data and system functions will be strictly limited to what is required for their specific job role. For example, a phlebotomist should be able to view test orders but not modify or release final results.48
●	Comprehensive Audit Trails: The system must maintain a detailed, immutable log of all activities involving PHI. This log must capture every instance of a user accessing, creating, modifying, or deleting PHI, recording the user's ID, the patient data involved, the date, and the time of the action. These audit logs must be protected from modification and retained for a minimum of six years.49
●	Data Encryption: All PHI managed by LabWise must be encrypted at all times. This includes encryption "at rest" within the database (e.g., using AES-256) and encryption "in transit" whenever data is transmitted over a network (e.g., using TLS 1.2 or higher).48
●	Patient Right of Access: The system must include functionality, such as the patient portal, that allows individuals to exercise their right to access and receive a copy of their own health information.19

CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)

CLIA regulations establish quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of patient test results. LabWise is a critical tool for maintaining and demonstrating CLIA compliance.
●	Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Management: The system must include a document management module where the laboratory can upload, store, and manage version control for all its SOPs. The system must ensure that the current, approved version of any procedure is readily available to all staff.4
●	Record Retention: CLIA mandates specific retention periods for various records. LabWise must be configured to retain all patient test records, quality control data, instrument maintenance logs, and personnel competency records for a minimum of two years.4
●	Quality Systems: The core functional modules for Quality Control (Section 3.3) and Inventory Management (Section 3.4) are direct implementations of CLIA's requirements for a comprehensive quality system.

GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

While LabWise is primarily intended for the US market, it must be designed with an awareness of global data privacy standards. If the system is used to process data for any individual residing in the European Union, it must comply with GDPR. This includes adhering to principles of lawful basis for processing, explicit consent, data minimization, and honoring data subject rights such as the right to erasure.52
The following checklist explicitly maps key regulatory requirements to their corresponding LabWise features, serving as a tool to guide development and simplify future audits.
Regulation	Requirement	LabWise Feature	Verification Method
HIPAA 45 CFR 164.312(b)	Audit Controls: Implement mechanisms to record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI.	Immutable Audit Trail: System-wide logging of all user actions involving PHI (view, create, modify, delete).	Generate an audit report for a selected patient, showing a complete history of all access events, including user, timestamp, and action taken.
HIPAA 45 CFR 164.312(a)(1)	Access Control: Implement policies and procedures to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights.	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Module: Granular permissions assigned to user roles (e.g., Technician, Manager, Receptionist) to enforce the minimum necessary standard.	Log in as a 'Receptionist' user and verify that functions like 'Verify Results' are disabled. Log in as a 'Technician' and verify that administrative functions are inaccessible.
CLIA 42 CFR 493.1256	Control Procedures: The laboratory must have control procedures to monitor the accuracy and precision of the complete analytical process.	Quality Control (QC) Module: Levey-Jennings charts, configurable Westgard rules engine, and mandatory corrective action documentation for QC failures.	Enter a QC result that violates a Westgard rule and verify that the system flags the run as 'out of control' and prevents the release of associated patient results.
CLIA 42 CFR 493.1291	Test Report: The laboratory must have an adequate manual or electronic system(s) in place to ensure test results and other patient-specific data are accurately and reliably sent from the point of data entry to the final report destination.	Result Verification Workflow & Report Generation Module: Electronic sign-off for verified results, customizable report templates, and secure electronic delivery to EHR/portals.	Process a sample from order entry to final report and verify that the result on the final PDF report exactly matches the verified result in the LIS.
CLIA 42 CFR 493.1105	Record Retention: The laboratory must retain all records for a minimum of two years.	Archiving and Data Retention Policy Engine: System configured to retain all patient, QC, and maintenance records for the required period.	Query the system for a patient result that is more than two years old and verify that the record is still accessible.

Interoperability

A modern LIMS cannot function as an isolated island. It must be a connected hub within the broader healthcare IT ecosystem, capable of seamless and secure data exchange with a variety of other systems.
Requirements:
●	Instrument Interfaces: LabWise must support standard laboratory interfacing protocols, such as Health Level Seven (HL7) and ASTM, to enable bidirectional communication with a wide range of analytical instruments from different manufacturers. This allows the LIS to download orders to the instrument and upload results from the instrument automatically.
●	EHR/HIS Integration: The system must support modern health data exchange standards, including HL7 v2.x and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). This is essential for receiving electronic orders from external physician EHR systems and for transmitting final, formatted reports back into the patient's legal medical record.
●	API Access: LabWise will provide a secure, well-documented, and robust RESTful Application Programming Interface (API). This will allow for custom integrations with other third-party systems, such as advanced billing platforms, clinical research databases, or business intelligence tools, providing flexibility and future-proofing the system.55

System Performance and Reliability

The clinical laboratory is often a 24/7 operation, and LabWise must be engineered to match this demand. System downtime is not a mere inconvenience; it directly halts patient testing, delays diagnoses, and can compromise patient care.
Requirements:
●	System Uptime: The production environment for LabWise must be architected for high availability, guaranteeing a minimum of 99.9% uptime, excluding pre-scheduled and communicated maintenance windows.
●	Data Backup and Redundancy: The system must perform automated, full database backups on a regular schedule (e.g., nightly), with incremental backups occurring more frequently. All backups must be encrypted and stored in a secure, geographically separate location to protect against localized disasters.
●	Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP): A comprehensive DRP must be in place and documented. This plan will detail the procedures for restoring service in the event of a catastrophic failure. It must define a clear Recovery Time Objective (RTO)—the maximum acceptable time for the system to be offline—and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO)—the maximum acceptable amount of data loss.
