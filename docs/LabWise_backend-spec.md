LabFlow Technical Specification: Data Architecture and API Design


Part 1: The LabFlow Data Architecture: A MongoDB Schema


1.1 Core Architectural Principles

The design of the LabFlow database schema is governed by a set of foundational principles derived directly from the system's core business objectives: ensuring unparalleled data integrity, facilitating stringent regulatory compliance, and enabling high-performance, scalable laboratory operations.1 The architecture is not merely a data store but an active component in enforcing the business rules and workflows that define a modern clinical laboratory.

1.1.1 Rationale for a Document-Oriented Database (MongoDB)

The selection of MongoDB as the core database technology is a strategic decision rooted in the nature of clinical laboratory data. The central entity in the LabFlow ecosystem is the Order, which represents a complete patient testing event. This event is a complex, hierarchical structure encompassing patient information, one or more physical samples, multiple tests performed on each sample, and the resulting data.
In a traditional relational database, representing a single Order would necessitate joining across numerous tables (e.g., patients, orders, samples, tests, results). While normalized, this approach introduces significant performance overhead for read operations, which are the most common in a LIMS environment (e.g., fetching an order to view its status, retrieving results for a report).
A document-oriented model, by contrast, allows for the Order to be stored as a single, rich JSON document. This structure naturally maps to the real-world entity, co-locating all related data. This co-location dramatically improves read performance, as a single query can retrieve the entire order without complex joins. Furthermore, MongoDB's flexible schema is highly advantageous in a clinical setting. As the laboratory introduces new, specialized tests, they may come with unique result formats or data fields. A document model can accommodate these variations without requiring disruptive, schema-wide migrations, providing essential agility.1

1.1.2 Data Modeling Strategy: A Hybrid Approach to Relationships

To balance the benefits of data co-location with the need for data consistency and a single source of truth, LabFlow will employ a hybrid data modeling strategy that intelligently combines data embedding with referencing.
●	Embedding: Data that is intrinsically part of an object and has a one-to-few relationship will be embedded. For example, the test results for a specific sample are part of that sample's record and will be embedded within the Order document. This optimizes for the common use case of retrieving an order and all its results simultaneously.
●	Referencing: Data that has a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship, or data that is frequently updated and referenced by multiple other documents, will be stored in a separate collection and linked via an ObjectId reference. The canonical example is the Patient record. A single patient may have hundreds of orders over time. Storing the full patient demographic data in every order would lead to massive data duplication and create a consistency nightmare if the patient's address or phone number needed to be updated. Instead, each Order will store a reference to the single, authoritative Patient document.1

1.1.3 The Criticality of Snapshotting for Regulatory Compliance

A more nuanced and critical aspect of the data model is the deliberate de-normalization, or "snapshotting," of version-dependent data for regulatory compliance. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) mandate that all patient test records be accurate and auditable, reflecting the exact conditions under which a test was performed.1
Laboratory test definitions are not static. A test's reference range might be updated due to a new reagent lot, a change in methodology, or a new population study. If an Order document from six months ago merely contained a reference to the testCatalog entry for "Glucose," viewing that patient's report today would incorrectly apply the current glucose reference range, not the one that was valid at the time of testing. This would constitute a major compliance failure and a potential patient safety risk.
To prevent this, the LabFlow architecture mandates that when a test is added to an order, critical, version-specific information from the testCatalog is snapshotted directly into the Order document. This includes the test name, methodology, units, and, most importantly, the exact reference range that was in effect on that date. This transforms the Order document from a simple transactional record into a self-contained, immutable, and legally auditable artifact that guarantees historical accuracy, irrespective of any future changes to the laboratory's test catalog. This design choice is a non-negotiable cornerstone of the system's compliance strategy.1
The following table provides a high-level overview of the primary collections and their relationships, illustrating this hybrid approach.

Part 2: The LabFlow Application Programming Interface (API) Specification


2.1 General Principles & Conventions

The LabFlow RESTful API is designed to be predictable, consistent, and secure. All interactions with the API will adhere to the following global conventions.
●	Authentication: With the exception of the public login endpoint, all API endpoints are protected and require a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) to be passed in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme. The JWT payload will contain the userId and role, which are decoded and used by the server for authentication and authorization on every request.
●	API Versioning: All API endpoints are prefixed with /api/v1/. This ensures that future iterations of the API can be introduced without breaking existing client integrations.
●	Standardized Error Responses: The API will use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. All error responses (4xx and 5xx status codes) will return a JSON body with a consistent structure to simplify client-side error handling:
JSON
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "Patient with the specified MRN was not found.",
  "error": "Not Found"
}

●	Pagination: All GET endpoints that return a list of resources (e.g., /api/v1/patients, /api/v1/orders) will implement cursor-based pagination to ensure efficient and scalable data retrieval. Requests will accept limit (e.g., ?limit=50) and nextCursor query parameters. The response will include a pagination object containing the nextCursor value needed to fetch the subsequent page.

2.2 Security: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Security and compliance are not afterthoughts; they are architected into the core of the API through a stringent Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. This system directly enforces the "minimum necessary" principle required by HIPAA.1

2.2.1 RBAC Enforcement Middleware

Every authenticated request to the API will pass through a dedicated RBAC middleware layer before reaching the business logic controller. This middleware will perform the following steps:
1.	Decode the JWT from the Authorization header to extract the user's _id and role.
2.	Look up the required permissions for the requested endpoint and HTTP method (e.g., POST /api/v1/patients) in a predefined access control list.
3.	Compare the user's role against the required permissions.
4.	If the user's role is permitted, the request is passed to the next handler in the chain.
5.	If the user's role is not permitted, the request is immediately rejected with a 403 Forbidden status code and an appropriate error message.
This centralized enforcement mechanism ensures that access control rules are applied consistently across the entire API and cannot be accidentally bypassed by individual endpoint handlers.

2.2.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Matrix

The following matrix serves as the definitive specification for the RBAC middleware. It maps every user role to their permitted actions on each major API resource. C=Create, R=Read, U=Update, D=Delete. A blank cell indicates the action is forbidden.
Endpoint	Method	Receptionist	Technician	Manager	Physician	Patient
/auth/login	POST	C	C	C	C	C
/auth/me	GET	R	R	R	R	R
/users	POST			C		
/users	GET			R		
/users/{id}	GET			R		
/users/{id}	PUT			U		
/patients	POST	C		C		
/patients	GET	R	R (Limited)	R		
/patients/{id}	GET	R	R (Limited)	R		
/patients/{id}	PUT	U		U		
/orders	POST	C		C	C	
/orders	GET	R	R (Worklist)	R	R (Own)	R (Own)
/orders/{id}	GET	R	R	R	R (Own)	R (Own)
/samples/accession	POST		C	C		
/samples/{accNum}/reject	POST		C	C		
/results/verify	POST		C	C		
/inventory	POST			C		
/inventory	GET		R (Read-only)	R		
/inventory/{id}	PUT			U		
/reports/kpi	GET			R		
/audit-logs	GET			R		
Note on Limited Fields: A Technician's R access to patients will be restricted at the application layer to only return necessary identifiers (Name, DOB, MRN) and not sensitive contact or insurance information. A Physician or Patient's R access to orders is restricted to only those orders they are associated with.

2.3 Asynchronous Workflows & External Integrations

Certain operations within LabFlow are either long-running or dependent on external, third-party systems. Forcing these operations to run synchronously within an API request would lead to a poor user experience (e.g., a frozen UI) and make the system brittle (e.g., an outage in an external service could crash the LabFlow API).
To address this, LabFlow will utilize a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) to decouple these tasks from the main API request/response cycle. This pattern is essential for features like:
●	Real-time Insurance Eligibility Checks (US-REC-02): Communicating with an external insurance provider's API can be slow.
●	Automated Critical Value Alerts (US-PHY-03): Sending SMS messages or emails via a third-party service should not block the result verification process.
●	Large Report Generation: Compiling a complex PDF report with historical data and trend graphs can be resource-intensive.
The asynchronous workflow will be as follows:
1.	The client sends a request to a specific API endpoint (e.g., POST /api/v1/patients/{id}/verify-eligibility).
2.	The API endpoint performs initial validation on the request and, if valid, immediately publishes a "job" message to the message queue. This message contains all the information needed to perform the task.
3.	The API instantly responds to the client with a 202 Accepted status code. The response body includes a jobId that the client can use to track the status of the asynchronous task.
4.	A separate, dedicated "worker" service, running independently of the API server, consumes messages from the queue. It performs the long-running task (e.g., calls the insurance API).
5.	Upon completion, the worker service updates the status of the job in the database and can push a real-time notification to the client via WebSockets.
This architecture makes the application feel significantly faster to the user, increases system resilience, and allows for independent scaling of the API and background worker services.
